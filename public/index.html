		<h1>Braid</h1>
		<p>This server is running <a href='https://github.com/kduffie/braid-server' target="_blank">braid-server</a> version 0.2.1.</p>
		
		<p>Braid servers connect clients running multi-user collaborative apps.  These apps can
		run on virtually any device and interoperate with anyone else on this or any other reachable
		braid server.</p>
		
		<p>Braid can be used on public or private networks.  It is designed
		to federate, so that users in different domains using different servers can work
		together.</p>
		
		<p>To exercise the basic functionality of this braid server, try the <a href='test-client/braid-client.html'>test client</a>.</p>		
		<p>Open your browser's inspector to see the messages exchanged between this web client and the server over a braid socket.</p>
